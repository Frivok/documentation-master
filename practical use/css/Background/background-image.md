# CSS background-image

```bash
The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

Example

The background image for a page can be set like this: 

body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}

Example

This example shows a bad combination of text and background image. The text is hardly readable: 
body {
  background-image: url("bgdesert.jpg");
}

Note: When using a background image, use an image that does not disturb the text.
```
