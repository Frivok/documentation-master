# CSS Outline - Shorthand property

```bash
The outline property is a shorthand property for setting the following individual outline properties:

    outline-width
    outline-style (required)
    outline-color

The outline property is specified as one, two, or three values from the list above. The order of the values does not matter.

The following example shows some outlines specified with the shorthand outline property:

A dashed outline.

A dotted red outline.

A 5px solid yellow outline.

A thick ridge pink outline.

Example

p.ex1 {outline: dashed;}
p.ex2 {outline: dotted red;}
p.ex3 {outline: 5px solid yellow;}
p.ex4 {outline: thick ridge pink;}
```
