# Horizontal Alignment

The text-align property sets the horizontal alignment (like left, right, or center) of the content in <th> or <td>.

By default, the content of <th> elements are center-aligned and the content of <td> elements are left-aligned.

The following example left-aligns the text in <th> elements:
Example
th {
  text-align: left;
}

# Vertical Alignment

```css
The vertical-align property sets the vertical alignment (like top, bottom, or middle) of the content in <th> or <td>.

By default, the vertical alignment of the content in a table is middle (for both <th> and <td> elements).

The following example sets the vertical text alignment to bottom for <td> elements:

Example

td {
  height: 50px;
  vertical-align: bottom;
}
```
