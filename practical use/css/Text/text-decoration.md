# Text Decoration

```bash
The text-decoration property is used to set or remove decorations from text.

The value text-decoration: none; is often used to remove underlines from links:

Example

a {
  text-decoration: none;
}

The other text-decoration values are used to decorate text:

Example

h1 {
  text-decoration: overline;
}

h2 {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}

h3 {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

Note: It is not recommended to underline text that is not a link, as this often confuses the reader.
